> in Berlin

Two weeks ago, I visited Berlin to join the clojure bridge workshop as a Korean participant.
Actually I am not beginners for clojure, but I have a plan to oraganize the clojure-bridge in korea.
This is my first clojure-bridge workshop, so i'd like to write something about memorable things.

## 1. Name tag

![nametag](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/562341/21099982/b9351224-c0b4-11e6-9f43-b1a20659fd3d.png)

As you can see in the picture, the name tag contains four interesting contents.

- **Name** : your name
- **Picture** for SNS
  - green : "allow to photos and share"
  - orange : "allow if asking"
  - red : "don't want to share"
- **Pronouns** : what you want to be called; he/she/they(!)
- **Group Number**

and

- **Gold star sticker** : You get a star when you finish installing a software .

I like this system(?) of nametag. It is very simple and useful.
Especially, `Picture` and `Pronouns`.

I also share Franka's Tweet with description of name tag.
She is one of clojure-bridge oranizers. (That's why she doesn't have the Group number.)

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is what name tags look like for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/clojurebridge?src=hash">#clojurebridge</a> Berlin: Name, pronouns, install status, pictures for social media yes/no. <a href="https://t.co/JvyrvtVEtQ">pic.twitter.com/JvyrvtVEtQ</a></p>&mdash; Franka (@franschm) <a href="https://twitter.com/franschm/status/804648608289136640">December 2, 2016</a></blockquote>

## 2. Nonbinary people

I heard the word "non-binary people" for the first time in my life(!).  
Kind Malwine explained the meaning of it to me. She's also the member of the organizer.  
It is about gender, any gender identity which does not fit within the binary of male and female.

I like that word.

## 3. Food & Items by Sponsor

## 4. berlin conduct

`clojure-bridge` workshop follows berlin conduct.
[berlincodeofconduct.org] was so impressive, because i've never seen that kind of thing in any workshops held in Korea. I think it is so important that  I'll share the exact 'code of conduct' by referring to the official website:

> The code of conduct outlines our expectations for all who participante in our community,
as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.
> - in clojure-bridge workshop

> A primary goal of all the conferences and user groups that refer to this Code of Conduct is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and religion (or lack thereof).

## 5. quil & night code

[quil] & [nightcode] are great library and easy tool for beginner.
When I open clojure-bridge workshop, I will also use those.

If you are beginner and want to feel comfortable about Clojure, I recommend it.

## 6.Demo

Even though they introduced themselves as beginners, they all had a great Demo presentations.

![demo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/562341/21100720/faca8378-c0b8-11e6-8ae6-ebc9e30856f3.jpg)

## 7. People

![all](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/562341/21098501/dcabb080-c0ac-11e6-89bf-5120d1de01fa.jpg)

People I met in the workshop are really really amazing.

They are..

- **kind** organizers
- **passionate** speakers
- **great** coaches & teaching assistants
- **wonderful** participants

In My Group 8 , we emphasize `"Don't be sorry (about questions)"`,  
so all participants join with freely.
