> in Berlin

Hello, I'm Minsun in Korea.  
In November, 2weeks ago, I have visited Berlin to join ther clojure-bridge workshop!

This is my first clojure-bridge workshop, so i'd like to write something about impressive.

## 1. Name tag

![nametag](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/562341/21099982/b9351224-c0b4-11e6-9f43-b1a20659fd3d.png)

As you can see, the name tag consists of four factors

- **Name** : your name
- **Picture** for SNS
  - green : "allow to photos and share"
  - orange : "allow if asking"
  - red : "don't want to share"
- **Pronouns** : your pronoun, she/he/they ..
- **Group Number** : Group Number

and

- **Gold star sticker** : You get a star if you finished "install software"

I share Franks's Tweet. She is one of clojure-bridge oranizer.
(so she don't have Group number)

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is what name tags look like for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/clojurebridge?src=hash">#clojurebridge</a> Berlin: Name, pronouns, install status, pictures for social media yes/no. <a href="https://t.co/JvyrvtVEtQ">pic.twitter.com/JvyrvtVEtQ</a></p>&mdash; Franka (@franschm) <a href="https://twitter.com/franschm/status/804648608289136640">December 2, 2016</a></blockquote>

I heard first time that word "non-binary people"!
@malwine describe about this.
Any gender identity which does not fit within the binary of male and female.
I like that word.

## 3. Food & Items by Sponser

## 4. berlin conduct

clojure-bridge workshop follows berlin conduct.
[berlincodeofconduct.org] is fresh, because i've never seen that kind of things.
But I think important.

> The code of conduct outlines our expectations for all who participante in our community,
as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

> A primary goal of all the conferences and user groups that refer to this Code of Conduct is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and religion (or lack thereof).

## 5. quil & night code

[quil] & [nightcode] are great library and esay tool for beginner.
If I will open clojure-bridge workshop, I will also use that.
If you are beginner and want to feel clojure, I recommend it.

## 6.Demo

Even they are beginners, all participants make it.
